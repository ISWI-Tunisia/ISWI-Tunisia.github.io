TITLE: ISWI-Tunisia

LSAMA's Very Low Frequencies (VLF) team at the "University of Tunis El Manar" : "http://www.utm.rnu.tn/utm/fr/" is part of the International Space Weather Initiative ("ISWI" : "http://www.iswi-secretariat.org/"), a program founded and established by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space ("COPUOS" : "http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/copuos/index.html") within the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs ("UNOOSA" : "http://www.unoosa.org/"). Our team studies the Earth's electrical environment through the effects of thunderstorm activity, seismic activity, solar activity, volcanic activity and solar eclipses on its upper atmosphere composed of ionosphere and magnetosphere as well as radiation belts.

!bnotice AWESOME Monitor 
Atmospheric Weather Electromagnetic System for Observation Modeling and Education

FIGURE: [media/awesom_mon, width=200 frac=1.0]

* Student and researcher use 
* Moderate cost     
* Receives all VLF stations and covers frequencies 30Hz -50 KHz simultaneously 
* High-resolution 16-bit     
* Accurate timing via GPS 
* Monitors solar SID’s, lightning, GRB's, ionospheric phenomena, etc. 
* Requires 2 antennas: N/S and E/W and a location such as a field  to set up. 
* Requires a computer with processing power to keep up with high-speed data stream and FFT calculations.
